TBD: embedding_cgk.py #load, MAXLEN, transform deprecated

2018.03.19

summary:
- improve whole framework: consistent pipeline; support nn prediction and downstream analysis (histogram and roc); use seq2nn to handle data transform for both train and inference etc

train.py
- add prepare data (not using tf.FLAGS)
- better console interface

simulate_data.py
- pairwise dist file supports multiple dist types (e.g. calc_non_learned_dist)
- calc_dist_1thread: use seq2nn; pt to set max_num_dist_1thread for quick verification of code flow
- calc_dist_Nthread: related changes based on calc_dist_1thread

proc_data.py
- disable transform (e.g. global variables usage)

inference.py
- maxlen and blocklen no longer global variables; to be saved into model and restored later
- add Predict, seq2nn for prediction based on trained model
- add Fa_tseq class for prediction based on trained model
- load: apply seq2nn
- load2: use args and seq2nn

indel_channel.py
- support bin/dna seq
- support calc num of sampled seq per cluster by tot_num*weigt or fixed copy_num

simulate_data.py
- weight normalized
- sample from cluster using 1 thread or multiple threads

util.py
- add run_cmds
- add split_fa_file and merge_files

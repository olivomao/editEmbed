========[1] binary_seq_pair format (deprecated)

## python command
...
[i]
seq_x in binary format
seq_y in binary format
d(seq_x, seq_y)
...




========[2] binary_seq_pair format

## python command
...
[seq_x in binary format]\t[seq_y in binary format]\td(seq_x, seq_y)
...




========[3] cluster_center_fa format

>seq_id  gene=gene_id weight=wt
seq in binary or ATCG

Note:
- for simulated data, seq_id==gene_id. in practice, one gene_id may contain several seq_id (e.g. isoforms).
- weight is normalized. this is useful when tot number of sampled seqs is fixed, and we sample seqs from clusters in a parallel way (to split clusters)

========[4] sampled_seq_fa format

>seq_id		tid=cluster_seq_id		gene=gene_id	weight=wt
seq in binary or ATCG

Note:
- for simulated data, cluster_seq_id==gene_id. in practice, one gene_id may contain several cluster_seq_id (e.g. isoforms).
- one cluster_seq_id may have several sampled (noisy) seq_id

========[5] pairwise_distance format:

- header:
  #seq_id1	seq_id2		type	(distance1 e.g. edit distance)		[(distance2) etc]

- ids are obtained from:
  the seq_id in sampled_seq_fa format (known tid and gene)

- type: 0: sampled_seqs have same tid (e.g. cluster)
        1: different tid (different gene)
        2: different tid (same gene) ==> to be addressed when dealing with real data

========[6] embed_fa format

similar as fasta, just replace the seq with its embedding. e.g.

>seq [description]
ATCG

==>

>seq [description]
v1[,v2,...]

========[7] loss_log format

#i 		training_loss		validation_loss

[1] binary_seq_pair format (deprecated)

## python command
...
[i]
seq_x in binary format
seq_y in binary format
d(seq_x, seq_y)
...




[2] binary_seq_pair format

## python command
...
[seq_x in binary format]\t[seq_y in binary format]\td(seq_x, seq_y)
...




[3] cluster_center_fa format

>seq_id  gene=gene_id weight=wt
seq in binary or ATCG

Note:
- for simulated data, seq_id==gene_id. in practice, one gene_id may contain several seq_id (e.g. isoforms).
- weight is at relative value. when sample cluster center to obtain noisy samples, the number of samples of a particular cluster is proportional to this relative weight.
